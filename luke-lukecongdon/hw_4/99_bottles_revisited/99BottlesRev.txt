*Homework: 99 Bottles of Beer, revisited*

Remember the 99 Bottles of Beer assignment? For this assignment, you'll be creating a website that programatically displays the lyrics to that song. (The lyrics are available at http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html)
You'll need to create both an .html file and a .js file
In your HTML file, you'll want to have an unordered list (`<ul>`) that contains all of your lyrics
Each line of the song should appear inside of a list item (`<li>`) within that unordered list
Your JavaScript file should programatically append each line of the song to the page--no hard-coding lyrics in HTML!
