Ways to store functions:
    declare a function - you can declare a function anywhere and is hoisted to the top.
    function expression
    anonymous function - dont give the function any name, usually within another function
    methods - function within an object. value of a key

Functions and Callbacks
  asynchronous programming - waits for an action
    works with events and event handlers ex: el.onclick = ();
    AJAX - a method to call an API from a server

      var $yesButton = $('#yes-button');
      $yesButton.on('click', function(e){
      ...
      });
  First-class objects are data types.
  Higher-order Function - takes a function and returns a function
